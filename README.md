# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-
For this project is working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement the new webpage, 
- Keep the old webpage, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
